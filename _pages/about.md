I am a researcher in genetic epidemiology focused on uncovering the complex interactions that shape autoimmune disease risk. My work investigates gene-gene epistasis, epigenetic regulation, and the broader interactome underlying immune dysregulation, with a particular emphasis on Type 1 Diabetes.

I'm especially interested in integrating multi-omic data with methods from information theory and network science to better understand how biological systems contribute to disease susceptibility. My goal is to advance precision public health by identifying actionable patterns that inform early detection, prevention, and intervention strategies.
